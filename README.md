# Lotus
Game developed using Unity game engine within the project Planeta Debug with randomly assigned teammates. I had the role of guiding the programming team and developing the
systems of the game such as the dialogue system since I was the most experienced team member regarding using Unity and C#, therefore I not only programmed but also focused
on developing UML Diagrams, Gant diagrams and other resources for the team (you can find them in the documents folder, but they are only available in Spanish). During this
project we used the SCRUM methodology and it was an interesting challenge since we needed to coordinate with the rest of the team while having to deliver a playable demo on
a limited time budget. The requirements for the project were for it to be based on the problematics of climate change and to show some of the work of one research group,
specifically the Perinatal Epidemiology, Environmental Health and Clinical Research Group from Jaume I University. It also had to be developed in 2D using a game engine.
Given these requirements we decided to develop a puzzle-adventure game based around the idea of giving the player an interesting story about the Yakuza during which they
would unexpectedly discover the consequences of climate change on health when they found out the consequences it had on the main characters. You can download the demo in the realeses page of this repository.

## Portfolio relevance
I think this project is relevant as proof of my ability to develop good documentation that can lead to a complete project for an external organization with tight deadlines.
It also shows that I am capable of working in a team environment succesfully (while it actually being a really enjoyable experience for the whole team) and that I can make
use of the SCRUM methodology whick I persolly think is a really important and useful ability.

## Language note
Unfortunately most of this repository is in Spanish (including the code and the game itself) since part of the team was not fluent in English
and a translation was not possible within the tight time budget we had, feel free to contact me at diego.villabrille@uji.es for any explanation,
clarification or even translation that you are interested in.
